You may go to Lab 2 (go Lab#SE01-2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to create three classes in Java (Person, Account and Manager) that implement different algorithms or data structures, and to test them using JUnit.  These classes could include, for example, creating new objects, a data structure for storing and manipulating data (List), or a utility class for performing common operations (static).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tasks involved in this project include: \n\n\nDecide where your project will weight: Person or Account.\n\n\nCreating a new Maven or Gradle project and setting up the project structure.\n\n\nModifying the project’s pom.xml or build.gradle file to import the necessary dependencies, including JUnit for testing.\n\n\nImplementing the three required classes in Java, using appropriate algorithms and data structures.\n\n\nImplementing as well two basic pattern-designs: singleton and composition.\n\n\nWriting JUnit tests to verify that the classes work as expected.\n\n\n\nYou may attach the JUnit Test HTML results to documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an optional task, you could also consider allowing the user to input data via the console, rather than using hard-coded test data in your JUnit tests.  This would allow you to test the classes with a variety of different input data, and to interact with the classes in a more dynamic way.\n\n\nAfter mplementing two basic pattern-designs: singleton, composition your may think about factory."

    "text": "Solving discussion\n\nBase Classes\nHere, the Person class represents a person with a name, address and others. In the same way, Account class is a bank account. The AccountManager class contains static methods to perform withdrawal, transfer, and change pin operations on a Person and Account object.\npublic class Person {\n  private String name;\n  private String address;\n  // Other properties for a Person...\n\n  public Person(String name, String address) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.address = address;\n  }\n\n  // Getters and setters for Person properties...\n}\n\n\npublic class Account {\n  private String accountNumber;\n  private String pin;\n  private double balance;\n  // Other properties for an Account...\n\n  public Account(String accountNumber, String pin, double balance) {\n    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n    this.pin = pin;\n    this.balance = balance;\n  }\n\n  // Getters and setters for Account properties...\n}\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n    public static boolean withdrawal(Person person, double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0 && amount <= person.getBalance()) {\n            person.setBalance(person.getBalance() - amount);\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static boolean transfer(Person sender, Person receiver, double amount) {\n        if (amount > 0 && amount <= sender.getBalance()) {\n            sender.setBalance(sender.getBalance() - amount);\n            receiver.setBalance(receiver.getBalance() + amount);\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    public static boolean changePin(Person person, String oldPin, String newPin) {\n        if (person.getPin().equals(oldPin)) {\n            person.setPin(newPin);\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n\nPerson has Account\npublic class Person {\n  private String name;\n  private String surname;\n  private int age;\n  private Account account;\n\n  public Person(String name, String surname, int age, Account account) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.surname = surname;\n    this.age = age;\n    this.account = account;\n  }\n\n  public Account getAccount() {\n    return this.account;\n  }\n\n  public void setAccount(Account account) {\n    this.account = account;\n  }\n   // Getters and setters for Account properties...\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\n\nclass Person {\n  -name: String\n  -surname: String\n  -age: int\n  -account: Account\n}\n\nclass Account {\n  -accountNumber: String\n  -pin: int\n  -balance: double\n}\n\nPerson *-- Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n\nparticipant AccountManager as AccountManager\nparticipant Account as Account\nparticipant Person as Person\n\nAccountManager->>Person: transfer(amount, sender, receiver)\nPerson->>Account: updateBalance(-amount, sender)\nPerson->>Account: updateBalance(-amount, receiver)\nAccount-->>Person: transferDone(receipt)\nPerson-->>AccountManager: transferDone(receipt)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach #1: Singleton\nTo use the Singleton design pattern with a Person and Account class, you could create a singleton AccountManager class that manages the creation and operations of the Person and Account objects.\nThe AccountManager class would have a private constructor, to prevent multiple instances from being created, and a static getInstance method that returns the singleton instance of the class.\nThe AccountManager class would then have methods for performing various operations on the Person and Account objects, such as transferring money between accounts, withdrawing money from an account, or changing the PIN for an account.\nThese methods would be implemented using the Person and Account classes, and would be accessible to other classes through the singleton AccountManager instance.\nFor example, you could define the AccountManager, Person, and Account classes as follows:\npublic class AccountManager {\n  private static AccountManager instance;\n  private Person person;\n  private Account account;\n\n  private AccountManager() {\n    // Private constructor to prevent multiple instances\n  }\n\n  public static AccountManager getInstance() {\n    if (instance == null) {\n      instance = new AccountManager();\n    }\n    return instance;\n  }\n\n  public void transfer(Account from, Account to, double amount) {\n    // Transfer money from one account to another\n  }\n\n  public void withdraw(Account account, double amount) {\n    // Withdraw money from an account\n  }\n\n  public void changePin(Account account, String newPin) {\n    // Change the PIN for an account\n  }\n\n  // Other methods for managing Person and Account objects...\n}\nTo use the AccountManager class, other classes would simply need to call the getInstance method to obtain the singleton instance of the class, and then use the instance’s methods to perform operations on the Person and Account objects. For example:\n// Create a new Person and Account\n// be careful: where will these four Person objects go? \nAccountManager manager = AccountManager.getInstance();\nmanager.person = new Person(\"John Doe\", \"123 Main St.\");\nmanager.person = new Person(\"Carla Jameson\", \"323 Main St.\");\nmanager.person = new Person(\"Rafael Martin\", \"3 Glorious St.\");\nmanager.person = new Person(\"Pau Vila\", \"63 Sesamo St.\");\nBut maybe, this is not the best approach for several reasons …\n\n\nApproach #2: all static-methods AccountManager\nIt may work as follows. In fact, if we want to manage accounts (as a banking-centered problem, not a person-centered one), it could be better that Account has Person:\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\n\nclass Person {\n  -name: String\n  -surname: String\n  -age: int\n}\n\nclass Account {\n  -accountNumber: String\n  -pin: int\n  -balance: double\n  -person: Person\n}\n\nAccount *-- Person\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npublic class Account {\n  private Person person;\n  //other fields\n\n  public Account(Person person) {\n    this.person = person;\n  }\n\n  public Person getPerson() {\n    return this.person;\n  }\n\n  public void setPerson(Person person) {\n    this.person = person;\n    \n    //constructor, getters, setters and methods\n  }\n}\nSo, in this case, we could use a List object to save all the Account objects with the list:\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n  private List<Account> accounts;\n\n  private AccountManager() {\n    this.accounts = new ArrayList<>();\n  }\n\n  public List<Account> getAccounts() {\n    return this.accounts;\n  }\n\n  // we should manage how to add/remove accounts to/from accounts list\n\n  public static void deposit(Account account, double amount) {\n    // Code to deposit the specified amount to the account\n  }\n\n  public static void changePin(Account account, int newPin) {\n    // Code to change the PIN of the specified account\n  }\n\n  public static void transfer(Account fromAccount, Account toAccount, double amount) {\n    // Code to transfer the specified amount from the fromAccount to the toAccount\n  }\n  \n  public static void withdrawal(Account account, double amount) {\n    // Code to withdraw the specified amount from the given account\n  }\n}\n\n\nApproach 3: Singleton, any static-method\nIn this approach:\n\nAccount has Person\nAccountManager is Singleton and there is no static-methods anywhere\nand we create just one object form AccountManager to manage accounts\n\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n  private static AccountManager manager = new AccountManager();\n  private List<Account> accounts;\n\n  // we should manage how to add/remove accounts to/from accounts list\n\n  private AccountManager() {\n    this.accounts = new ArrayList<>();\n  }\n\n  public static AccountManager getInstance() {\n    return manager;\n  }\n\n  public List<Account> getAccounts() {\n    return this.accounts;\n  }\n\n  public  void deposit(Account account, double amount) {\n    // Code to deposit the specified amount to the account\n  }\n\n  public  void changePin(Account account, int newPin) {\n    // Code to change the PIN of the specified account\n  }\n\n  public  void transfer(Account fromAccount, Account toAccount, double amount) {\n    // Code to transfer the specified amount from the fromAccount to the toAccount\n  }\n  \n  public  void withdrawal(Account account, double amount) {\n    // Code to withdraw the specified amount from the given account\n  }\n}\n\n\nTest: AccountManagerTest\nAccountManagerTest could be like this:\n\nwith AccountManager all static-methods no-singleton\nAccount has Person\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;\n\npublic class AccountManagerTest {\n  @Test\n  public void testDeposit() {\n    Account account = new Account(new Person(\"John Doe\"));\n    double initialBalance = account.getBalance();\n    double depositAmount = 100.00;\n\n    AccountManager.deposit(account, depositAmount);\n    double finalBalance = account.getBalance();\n\n    assertEquals(initialBalance + depositAmount, finalBalance);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void testChangePin() {\n    Account account = new Account(new Person(\"John Doe\"));\n    int initialPin = account.getPin();\n    int newPin = 1234;\n\n    AccountManager.changePin(account, newPin);\n    int finalPin = account.getPin();\n\n    assertEquals(newPin, finalPin);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void testTransfer() {\n    Account fromAccount = new Account(new Person(\"John Doe\"));\n    Account toAccount = new Account(new Person(\"Jane Doe\"));\n    double initialFromAccountBalance = fromAccount.getBalance();\n    double initialToAccountBalance = toAccount.getBalance();\n    double transferAmount = 100.00;\n\n    AccountManager.transfer(fromAccount, toAccount, transferAmount);\n    double finalFromAccountBalance = fromAccount.getBalance();\n    double finalToAccountBalance = toAccount.getBalance();\n\n    assertEquals(initialFromAccountBalance - transferAmount, finalFromAccountBalance);\n    assertEquals(initialToAccountBalance + transferAmount, finalToAccountBalance);\n  }\n  \n  @Test\n  public void testWithdrawal() {\n    Account fromAccount = new Account(new Person(\"John Doe\"));\n    Account toAccount = new Account(new Person(\"Jane Doe\"));\n    double initialFromAccountBalance = fromAccount.getBalance();\n    double withdrawalAmount = 100.00;\n\n    AccountManager.withdrawal(fromAccount, withdrawalAmount);\n    double finalFromAccountBalance = fromAccount.getBalance();\n\n    assertEquals(initialFromAccountBalance - withdrawalAmount, finalFromAccountBalance);\n  }\n}"

    "text": "Solving discussion\n\nBase Classes: factory\nHere is an example of how you could create a Lombok Java class for a Person and Account using the factory pattern:\nimport lombok.AllArgsConstructor;\nimport lombok.Data;\n\n@Data\n@AllArgsConstructor\npublic class Person {\n    private String firstName;\n    private String lastName;\n}\n\npublic interface Account {\n    void deposit(double amount);\n    void withdraw(double amount);\n}\n\n\npublic class SavingsAccount implements Account {\n    private double balance;\n\n    public SavingsAccount(double balance) {\n        this.balance = balance;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        this.balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        this.balance -= amount;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class CheckingAccount implements Account {\n    private double balance;\n\n    public CheckingAccount(double balance) {\n        this.balance = balance;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        this.balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        this.balance -= amount;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n    public static Account createAccount(String accountType, double balance) {\n        if (accountType.equalsIgnoreCase(\"savings\")) {\n            return new SavingsAccount(balance);\n        } else if (accountType.equalsIgnoreCase(\"checking\")) {\n            return new CheckingAccount(balance);\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n}\nYou can then use these classes as follows:\nPerson john = new Person(\"John\", \"Doe\");\nAccount savingsAccount = AccountManager.createAccount(\"savings\", 100.00);\nAccount checkingAccount = AccountManager.createAccount(\"checking\", 50.00);\nThe AccountManager class uses the factory pattern to create Account objects based on the specified accountType. This allows you to create different types of accounts without having to specify the exact class to use, and makes it easier to add new types of accounts in the future.\n\n\nBase Classes: local storage-JSON\nHere is an example of what a Lombok-based Person class and Account class might look like in Java:\nimport lombok.Data;\n\n@Data\npublic class Person {\n  private String name;\n  private int age;\n  private String address;\n}\n\n@Data\npublic class Account {\n  private int accountNumber;\n  private double balance;\n  private Person owner;\n}\nThe @Data annotation is a **Lombok* annotation that automatically generates getters and setters for all non-static fields, as well as equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods. This can help reduce boilerplate code and make your classes more concise and readable.\nTo save data to a local JSON file, you could use a JSON library like Jackson to convert the objects to JSON strings, and then write those strings to a file. Here is an example of how you might do that:\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n  private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n\n  public void saveAccount(Account account) throws JsonProcessingException {\n    String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(account);\n    // write the JSON string to a file\n  }\n}\nHow to save an object as a JSON string to a file on your local storage (in this case, c:/data/accounts.json) using Java SE:\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n  private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n\n  public void saveAccount(Account account) throws JsonProcessingException, IOException {\n    String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(account);\n\n    FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(\"c:/data/accounts.json\");\n    fileWriter.write(json);\n    fileWriter.close();\n  }\n}"
